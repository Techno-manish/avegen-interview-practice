# Write a program to print first non repeating character of a string
"""
**Example:**

Input :Â  amazon

Output : m

To solve the problem of finding the first non-repeating character in a string, we can follow these steps:

1. **Traverse the String**: Go through each character in the string.
2. **Character Count**: Keep a count of each character's occurrence. This can be efficiently done using a dictionary in Python.
3. **Find the Non-Repeating Character**: Traverse the string again and use the dictionary to check the count of each character. The first character with a count of 1 is the non-repeating character.

Here's the implementation in Python:
"""

def firstNonRepChar(word):
    dict_a = {}
    for char in word:
        if char in dict_a:
            dict_a[char]+=1
        else:
            dict_a[char]=1
    for char,count in dict_a.items():
        if count==1:
            return char
    return  "No such char"
# word = "amazon"
word = input("Enter your word: ")
output = firstNonRepChar(word)
print(output)
